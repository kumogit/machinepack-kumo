  "readme": "# test-machinepack\nRaw test runner for machinepacks (also includes a generic driver)\n\n> Note that this built-in test driver is pretty basic-- I wouldn't recommend using it.  There is a better driver for mocha that you might enjoy: https://github.com/mikermcneil/test-machinepack-mocha\n> The point of this module is mainly to expose a test runner.\n>\n> Confused?  See http://node-machine.org for documentation.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g test-machinepack\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use the generic driver to run tests.  To do that, just `cd` into your machinepack and then run:\n\n```bash\ntestmachinepack\n```\n\n\n## Writing tests\n\nSo what do the tests look like?\nCheck out this example from [machinepack-npm](http://node-machine.org/machinepack-npm):\nhttps://github.com/mikermcneil/machinepack-npm/blob/master/tests/list-packages.json\n\n\n## Custom drivers\n\nWant to build a driver for the test framework of your choice?\nSee https://github.com/mikermcneil/test-machinepack-mocha for an example, and check out the files in this repo to see how the driver interface is exposed.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
